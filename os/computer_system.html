                        Events OS is waiting for after booted, is usually signalled by an <b>Interrupt</b>

                        When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers its execution
                        to a fixed location, which contains starting address for service routine for this interrupt

                        Recent architecture would save interrupted instruction address along with CPU state
                        (like register values) onto System Stack, when interrupt routine is serviced, interrupted
                        instruction address will be loaded back into program counter and CPU state will also be recovered
